# Web-Calculator
A web-based calculator built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, providing basic arithmetic functionality with a user-friendly interface.

This project will help me learn how to integrate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript by demonstrating how to structure a web page with HTML, style it effectively with CSS, and add dynamic functionality with JavaScript. I'll gain hands-on experience in DOM manipulation, event handling, and the practical application of programming concepts to create a fully functional, interactive calculator.
